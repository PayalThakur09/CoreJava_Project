# Brick Breaker Game Using Core Java

I create the mini-project name is brick breaker game,
Here I used my knowledge of Fundamental of Core
JAVA. In that Data structures like 2D arrays, Handling
Classes and Object creations, Java Swing and Java
AWT for creating a user-friendly GUI. Use the left, and
right keys to move the paddle left and right. The
current score is updated every time the ball hits the
brick and displayed. Game over if the ball does not hit
the paddle and goes out of the border. The player wins
when all bricks are broken
